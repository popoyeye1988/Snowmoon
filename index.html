HELLO WORLD, You Rock!
 
 <h1>
  My Cause
</h1>
  <p>
  Free medical care for everyone. I watched news that people have to travel to other countries to buy medicine such as insulin. 
    I believe this type of medicine should be more accessible to patient with disease.  I know people will say the scientists medicine company
    spend a lot of time and money to make this medicine. And some countries just took the intellectual property.
    I agree that the research institutions should be credited but the medicine is so essential to people's life which should be put at the first place.
